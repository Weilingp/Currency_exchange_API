# Using API to request historical daily currency exchange to make unified sales reports for international companies. 

## 
``` This is a play around a notebook that uses API to collect currency exchange rates to convert sales revenue for reporting cooperate sales in the same measure unit. This is to easy the stakeholder easy to make decisions.

When doing data analysis, it is normal to work with historical data. Therefore, historical months, including specific dates, need to be converted into a single currency for each country, so that shareholders can analyse how much the company has sold overall. Compare sales by region. This makes it easier for shareholders to analyse the overall sales of the company.

This is done by using the API to find the currency exchange rates for each day in the past and then multiplying them by the amount of sales in the foreign region using the uniform currency of the report, e.g. euro. The result is that all sales in the report are in the same currency.
